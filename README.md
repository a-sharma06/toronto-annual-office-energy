# Description

As sustainable planning and resilience become more widespread concers of urban administrations, it is important that information about energy cosnumption is easily accessible. However, currently there are very few cities which provide open energy data.

This project uses a linear regression model to estimate the annual energy consumption by office buildings in Toronto. This project uses 3 publically available datasets to create a statistical model between annual energy consumption and floor area. 

These datasets are:
1. Energy use and greenhouse gas emissions for the Broader Public Sector: https://www.ontario.ca/data/energy-use-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions-broader-public-sector
2. Address Points (Municipal) - Toronto One Address Repository: https://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=91415f9cd70bb210VgnVCM1000003dd60f89RCRD
3. Toronto 3D Massing Data- https://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=d431d477f9a3a410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD
